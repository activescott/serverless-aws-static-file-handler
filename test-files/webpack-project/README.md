# webpack example for serverless-aws-static-file-handler

Things can be a bit different when packed such as paths to files as noted in [issue #109](https://github.com/activescott/serverless-aws-static-file-handler/issues/109). This example/test is a repro of essentially that issue.
Shamelessly stolen from https://github.com/serverless-heaven/serverless-webpack/tree/master/examples/babel-webpack-4 and ever-so-slightly modified to include serverless-aws-static-file-handler.
